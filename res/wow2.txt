10.0, yeah right. This game is 7.5, 8.0 at best. After playing GW2 WoW just feels old and inconvenient. I predict one or two patches before Blizzard "Guild wars 2"-ifies World of Warcraft, e.g. Hearthstones and griffons will be replaced with "Goblin Tech" that will let you teleport to any previously visited inn, crafting and gathering will grant xp, you will not need to train gathering professions, you'll be able to move while casting non-channeled spells, there will be some sort of rip off of the discovery system, dynamic events, etc.

I am not interested in panda pokemon or farmville because I'm not eight years old or a sex offender. I have no reason to play this game. To me Azeroth's Golden Age was the Burning Crusade, Blizzard hasn't been able to capture the magic since then. Maybe it shouldn't have killed off all of its cool lore? Kel'Thuzad, Illidan, Arthas, Deathwing, all dead... introducing... panda pokemon farmville some stupid alliance dude and a second fiddle horde nobody that nobody gives a fig about?
