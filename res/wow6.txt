WoW is a fun MMORPG everyone seems to love. I loved it for the first 3 month I wasted on this game. It was a great experience playing as a Night Elf Rogue but when you hit lvl 60 that is probably the end of the fun. What can you do at 60? you can either grind for gold, raid (which gets boring), start all over again? The graphics isn't all that great but the most impressive thing is that there is no load time. It is a very addictive game and you can see that I am right because 8 million people are playing it. There are tons of quests, huge continent, lots of pvp, but at the end of the day you look back and say that I have wasted all my time and gotten nothing out of this game.
