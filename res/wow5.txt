Like any other MMO out there and does only very little better. No, mostly it just does what other MMOs do wrong aswell.

Repetitive; (You grind 10 lvl, move to the next area, goto grind;)
Everyone looks the same;
Blah blah etc. (just read mmo-reviews)

Notice that you deal and take always the same percentage of dmg. It has no economy, and crafting is waste of time. Go for alchemy as every other serious player would, and you will be fine.

Reviews about it's PvP content beeing great lack of substance, since this game isn't balanced. So be prepared to be ganked.

Basicly its a chat-room, don't believe this game has any kind of skill to it.
That's it for the gameplay.

Technically it's not good neither, be prepared to patch it 20 times after installing the retail.

It's too bad that Gamespot jumped on the Hype-Train this game produced.
I cancelled my Subscription for good.
