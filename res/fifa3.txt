 Well i couldn't hold back the anticipation as i ripped the nylon covering off my spanking new copy of Fifa 15, i popped it into my ps4 and was immediately greeted with the familiar beep and the blue glow that runs across the top of the console, all the while imagining all the next gen things oi was about the experience like maybe fans ripping off their jerseys and streaking across the pitch?

Alas i log on click on the icon of game showing Lionel Messi about to hit a superb curling shot, ( my imagination was on overdrive)

The Title screen comes up and i am greeted with an image of Messi in full 4k glory and the FIFA15 logo and my heart stops, i hit the X button to get to the start screen, and immediately you are transported to a match between Liverpool FC and Manchester City.

The first thing you notice is a slight graphics improvement over its predecessor, the players feel more solid on the ball and from afar you can readily tell who each player. The passes are more fluid and and player runs seem more intelligent and intuitive. While the graphics have been improved it doesn't look like a major milestone shift in realistic looks, the major improvements you would notice are in the spectators and stadium stands. The close ups are were you actually get disappointed graphics wise, players look pale and plastic as usual, though the ape like walk during substitutions while reduced is still very much there.

Presentation wise Fifa 15 doesn't let you down as EA show off their licencing rights, like matches between two English teems looks like a Sky sports HD match on Saturday.

Well ti be honest the game play while similar to last years Fifa does take some getting used to as at first i was over running passes, couldn't string any good through balls and such but all around the game feels much improved over last year.

Is the game great yes most definitely would i score it a 10 not really, because i had way too much expectations looking at last years edition but i guess alot of you may disagree with me on that, but its a matter of personal opinion really.
