As usual anymore...no instruction manual, learn as you go. if you've played call of duty before its pretty much the same EXCEPT NO INSTRUCTIONS on how to fly etc....and the so-called advanced weapons?? not even!! graphics are dull and cartoonish...it's fun to play but that's just because it's COD. FUN. COOL. DULL. THEY WILL NEVER TOP THE ORIGINAL COD BLACK OPS (or so it seems) hey COD...GET WITH IT HEY?
