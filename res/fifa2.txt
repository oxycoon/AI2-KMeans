This is the worst FIFA game I have ever played. They try to make it "More realistic" yet it is far from that. This game takes multiple steps backward in the realistic category. The CPU is unrealistically good, and somehow breaks simple laws of physics and the rules of soccer, yet somehow get away with it. Don't try to play defense in this game, it's impossible. The CPU knows every move you're about to make and knows exactly how to beat you. They'll score pretty much every possession. They have perfect slide tackles, they can basically do things that aren't physically possible for humans, and foul all the time, yet never get called. The creators of this game clearly were high or have some form of autism because it is the worst game EA has ever made. They need to stop trying to make the play more realistic and make sure they keep it an enjoyable gameplay. I cannot play this game without wondering how the creators graduated middle school, or if they know anything about soccer in general. Players far outperform their physical abilities, and the physical capabilities of a human in general. It's literally impossible to do anything against the computer. I went from FIFA 13 to this game, and after one week I have resolved to return the game. If you already have a FIFA game, don't bother buying this crap. If you don't have one, buy a different one. This game does not make sense. I shouldn't want to punch a hole through my TV while playing because of some bullshit that happens. I consistently beat opponents on FIFA 13 on world class difficulty, so I'm not just a shitty, disgruntled gamer. I know what I'm talking about, I have several friends who are soccer players who agree with me. This game is not realistic. It is impossibly unrealistic. Don't waste your money on this game, save $50 and get FIFA 13.
