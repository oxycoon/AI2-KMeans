Where can I start? that LEAP from Fifa 14 to Fifa 15 on the PC is extraordinary by all means and measures.. I never tried Fifa 14 next gen version... and when I played that Fifa 15 demo .. maybe some people could imagine the look on my face :O !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Even the Fifa 15 demo was more than rich in content, that it made me busy till release... I waited eagerly yesterday for the launch and I finally got my hands on the full game !!!! :D :D :D I am speechlessssss and IMPRESSED by that amazing most perfectly realized football game ever created on the face of the planet !!! where can I start from perfect absolutely perfect graphics, physics, ongoing match flow, these goalkeeper saves and animations and tackles !! MY GOD when I saw the highlights after the match for the first time I thought it was a promotional video from EA in the demo ... was THAT actual gameplay running on my PC ????!!!!! again :O !!!! I called my friends and showed them the game ... and we were all sitting :O :O :O next to each other,,, last year I did not pre-order Fifa 14 and I got it after a heavy price drop from Origin because I tried PES 2014 with that lie called the FOX engine (believe it or not I was a hardcore PES fan until 2011).. well this year I did not even have the time to try PES 2015 demo on the PS3... I just blindly and without thinking got myself the ultimate FIFA 15 version.. and I don't really care if I use all of its exclusive content .... If I was asked to pay a 100 more for that game I would simply give them my money without even thinking !! If you are a PES fan or a FIFA fan but have a good specs. PC ... GO GET THIS GAME NOW, ITS A GEM..... All I want to do is THANK EA VERY FREAKIN MUCH for everything about this game... I LOVE IT, can't wait to spend tons of hours on it !!!!!!
